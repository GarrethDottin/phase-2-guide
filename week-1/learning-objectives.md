# Phase 2 Week 1 Learning Objectives

_WARNING_ It's important to realize that you are likely intimidated by this
scary list. Keep in mind that all you should be worrying about is the 1 thumb
stuff until you either: find something incredibly interesting *or* start to feel
bored. Then go for those 2 or 3 thumb objectives!

1. [Coders Mindset](learning-objectives/coders-mindset.md)
1. [Testing and TDD](learning-objectives/testing-and-tdd.md)
1. [Debugging](learning-objectives/debugging.md)
1. [Ruby Webapps](learning-objectives/ruby-webapps.md)
1. [ActiveRecord](learning-objectives/activerecord.md)
1. [HTML and CSS](learning-objectives/html-and-css.md)

## Self Evaluation Card

Spend a few minutes every day thinking about how you're doing with the weeks
learning objectives:

1. Copy and paste this score card into your `boots/your-name.md` file
2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Add a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.


| Coders Mindset | Testing & TDD | Debugging | Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord | HTML & CSS |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
|                |               |           |              |              |            |

### The Thumb System

Each learning objective has a series of behaviors or questions that you can use
to gauge where you sit on the thumb system. It's by no means comprehensive; and
is intended as a starting point for assessing your comprehension and competence.

* 1 thumb up indicates you're competent enough to be somewhat useful and able to
  work in it independently
* 2 means you're comfortable with the topic, and are actually productive in it
* 3 means you are zomg wtf amazi-craze you just tear through code in that topic
